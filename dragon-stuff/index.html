        <h2>So... I'm a dragon.</h2>
        <p class="normaltext">
            Yeah, really. It’s not just a metaphor or a cosplay thing. I identify as a dragon — specifically, I feel closest to SeaWings, a type of dragon from the <em>Wings of Fire</em> book series.
        </p>
        <p class="normaltext">
            It’s hard to explain to someone who hasn’t felt it, but the connection is deep and real. When I look at the ocean, when I swim, when I dream — I don’t just feel human. I feel like something more fluid, ancient, and free. That’s where my sense of “being a dragon” lives.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h2>Why SeaWings?</h2>
        <p class="normaltext">
            SeaWings have always resonated with me. They live in underwater kingdoms, communicate with bioluminescence, and are strong without being aggressive. That calm, intuitive energy feels like home to me.
        </p>
        <p class="normaltext">
            I like water, I like swimming, and I love the idea of a hidden world beneath the surface. I also enjoy rainy weather, glowing lights in the dark, and the peacefulness of deep oceans — all things I associate with SeaWings.
        </p>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h2>Spiritual, emotional, personal</h2>
        <p class="normaltext">
            My dragon identity isn’t just a fandom thing. It’s tied to how I experience the world emotionally and spiritually. Through dreams, meditation, and moments of quiet reflection, I keep reconnecting with this part of me.
        </p>
        <p class="normaltext">
            Sometimes I visualize my wings. Sometimes I just feel the presence — calm, strong, and wordless. It’s not about escaping reality — it’s about understanding myself more fully. The dragon isn’t separate from me. It is me.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (Dragon Edition)</h2>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Are you roleplaying?</strong><br>
  No. This isn't a character or act — it's part of who I am. Being a dragon is a personal identity, not a performance.</p>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Do you believe you're literally a dragon in a physical sense?</strong><br>
  No, I know I’m human-bodied. But internally, spiritually, and emotionally, I identify as a dragon. It’s about how I experience myself, not what I physically look like.</p>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Why SeaWings?</strong><br>
  Their calm, aquatic nature, bioluminescence, and underwater world resonate deeply with me. It’s hard to describe — it just feels right.</p>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Is this the same as being a furry?</strong><br>
  There's some overlap in community and interests, but not all dragon-identified folks are furries, and vice versa. For me, this is more internal than costume- or character-based.</p>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Is this connected to mental health?</strong><br>
  Not in a negative way. For many of us, it's a way of understanding ourselves better, not a disorder. It brings clarity, grounding, and sometimes even healing.</p>

  <p class="normaltext"><strong>Can I ask questions?</strong><br>
  Yes, if you’re respectful and genuinely curious, I'm always happy to talk. Just remember — this is personal, not a debate topic.</p>

    <div class="contentbox">
        <h2>Further Questions?</h2>
        <p class="normaltext">
            If you're curious or want to talk about dragons, identity, or anything related — I'm open to friendly conversations. Please be respectful, though. For many of us, this isn't just a quirky phase. It's something deeply personal.

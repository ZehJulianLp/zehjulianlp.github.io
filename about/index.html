        <h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="normaltext">Developer • Dragon • Structure nerd • Minecraft infrastructure architect</p>

    </div>
<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    Hi! I'm Julian — a developer, infrastructure geek, and dragon from Germany. I love combining logic and creativity to build digital systems that feel alive. Whether it's a transit network in Minecraft or a polished web interface, I enjoy bringing structure into the chaos.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>Developer in Training</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    I'm currently in Ausbildung as an IT specialist for application development. That means I spend my days working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and Python — but not just to write clean code. I care a lot about accessibility, maintainability and creating interfaces that make sense to humans, not just machines.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    I've always been the kind of person who builds things to understand them. Whether it’s automating processes, tinkering with microcontrollers, or dissecting why a specific UI just "feels right", I’m constantly trying to connect the practical with the intuitive.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>Redstone & Rails</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    My main creative outlet is Minecraft — but not in the usual way. I'm one of the core contributors to <strong>Redstone & Rails</strong>, a large collaborative Minecraft project that focuses on technical realism, infrastructure, and world simulation. I’ve planned entire subway networks, helped set standards for accessibility, designed operating procedures for fictional companies, and written JSON-based routing logic.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    It’s not just blocks — it’s systems thinking, storytelling, urban planning and engineering wrapped into one interactive space. And yes: we have our own fake public transport website.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>Dragons and Identity</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    Dragons have been with me for as long as I can remember — not just as fantasy creatures, but as something I deeply connect to. Especially SeaWings. There’s something about their calm, oceanic strength and silent intelligence that speaks to who I am.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    I express this side of me through dreams, guided meditations, art, and quiet moments of introspection. It's not always easy to put into words, but it feels authentic. It's a lens through which I understand myself and my inner world more clearly.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>What I Enjoy</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    Outside of dev stuff, I’m passionate about public transportation, urban design, and amusement parks — especially roller coasters. I also love listening to audiobooks and diving into fictional worlds. My favourite series include <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Wings of Fire</em>, and any good sci-fi that explores identity, society, or speculative tech.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    I'm also a fan of really specific memes, British humour, and random Wikipedia deep-dives that somehow end up in philosophical late-night Discord discussions.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>EDM Music & Sound Design</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    One of my creative passions is making electronic music. I produce a style that blends retro-inspired 80s synth vibes with modern ambient and game-like textures — people often tell me it sounds like the soundtrack to a sci-fi adventure or a pixel-art dream world.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    Music gives me a way to express moods and ideas that go beyond words — from the calm of deep oceans to the rush of a roller coaster. I compose tracks in my free time and use them for personal projects, videos, or just as sonic self-expression.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="contentbox">
  <h2>How I Think</h2>
  <p class="normaltext">
    I like structure. Known places give me calm. I thrive when I can plan ahead — but I’m also the kind of person who finds flow in the details: tweaking that one CSS file for hours, improving a data model, or optimizing a Redstone circuit just because it could be cleaner.
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext">
    Overwhelm happens when too many things hit at once — but I’ve learned how to ground myself, through routines, music, long showers, and — weirdly enough — Minecraft’s soothing rhythm.
  </p>
</div>
